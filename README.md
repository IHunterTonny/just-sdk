# PHP Just API

## Requirements
 - PHP >= 7.4
 - A PSR-17 implementation
 - A PSR-18 implementation

## Install preparations
Add package repository in `composer.json` of your project:
```bash
"repositories": [
    {
      "type": "github",
      "url": "https://github.com/IHunterTonny/php-just-api"
    }
  ]
```

## Quick install
This command will get you up and running quickly with Guzzle HTTP client, adapter and factory:
```bash
composer require just/api:dev-main guzzlehttp/guzzle:^7.0 php-http/guzzle7-adapter http-interop/http-factory-guzzle 
```

## Advanced install
We are decoupled from any HTTP messaging client with help by [HTTPlug](https://httplug.io).

### Using a different http client
```bash
composer require just/api:dev-main symfony/http-client nyholm/psr7
```

## Basic usage of `php-just-api`
```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$sdk = \Just\Sdk($options)->api('car')->result();
```

## Advanced usage of `php-just-api`
```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$options = new \Just\Options([
    'clientBuilder' => new \Symfony\Component\HttpClient\HttplugClient(),
    'apiVersion' => 'v3'
]);
$sdk = \Just\Sdk($options)->api('car')->result();

From `$sdk` object, you have access to all available PHP Just API endpoints.
